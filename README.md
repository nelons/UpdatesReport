# UpdatesReport

This is a program I wrote nearly 10 years ago that produces a report about WSUS updates and error codes for those updates that failed.

Some groups are hardcoded, so please check out the source code before running.

I offer no support for this, publishing in case someone finds it useful.

Also, I fully admit I'm not that great at C#, but it is fun to write.
